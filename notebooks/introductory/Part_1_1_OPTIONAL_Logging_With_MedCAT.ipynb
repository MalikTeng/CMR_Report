        "# MedCAT tutorial - logging with MedCAT\n",
        "How MedCAT handles logging has changed somewhat as of recently.\n",
        "The idea is that MedCAT as a library attempts to interfere as little as possible with its users choice of what, how and where to log information.\n",
        "\n",
        "The current startegy is 'opt in'. Which means that by default, all logging is disabled by MedCAT. However, we've added a shorthand for adding some handlers for console as well as _medcat.log_ logging. And on top of that, it is pretty simple for the user to change the logging behaviour of different parts of the project separately. We will go over that in small examples below."
